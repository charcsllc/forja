/**
 * ═══ THE ONE PLACE THE PRODUCT IS NAMED ═══════════════════════════════════════

 * Every user-facing mention of the product, the meta title, the storage key prefix and

 * file plus `src/app/icon.svg` and `src/components/brand/Logo.tsx`.
 *
 * ⚠️ "Lovable" is somebody else's trademark. This project is an ALTERNATIVE to it; the
 * word must never become the product name, the wordmark or the favicon.
