/**
 * ═══ THE COMPOSER'S ATTACHMENTS SURVIVE A RELOAD ════════════════════════════
 *
 * A file attached to the chat composer is ALREADY UPLOADED — `uploadAndAttach` sends
 * it to the project the moment it is picked or pasted, and what the chip holds from
 * then on is a name and the uploaded file's URL. Losing that on a reload is losing
 * nothing but a reference, while making the user find, re-pick and re-upload the file
 * (and pay the upload again). This keeps the reference.
 *
 * ⚠️ ONLY UPLOADED FILES BELONG HERE. The dashboard hero holds real `File` objects,
 * because there is no project yet to upload them to — those are not serialisable and
 * are deliberately not persisted. This module is for the workspace composer only.
 *
 * ⭐ `localStorage`, FOR THE SAME REASON AS THE TEXT DRAFT. An attachment is inert: it
 * populates a chip and waits, and nothing is spent until the user presses send. So the
 * rule that forces `sessionStorage` on a PENDING PROMPT (which starts a billable run
 * the moment it is read) does not apply, and `localStorage` survives the cases people
 * actually lose work to — a closed tab, a browser restart, a crash.
 *
 * ⚠️ KEYED PER PROJECT. Two projects must never show each other's attachments.
 *
 * ⚠️ EVERY FUNCTION IS SAFE IN SSR AND IN PRIVATE MODE. Storage may be absent (server
 * render) or throw (Safari private browsing, quota). Nothing here throws; the worst
 * case is that attachments stop persisting, which is the behaviour before this existed.
 */

const KEY_PREFIX = "totalum:attachments:project:";

/**
 * A week, matching the text draft. Long enough to cover a weekend; short enough that a
 * forgotten attachment does not ambush someone a month later.
 *
 * ⚠️ IT ALSO BOUNDS A DEAD LINK. The stored URL is a signed one. It does not expire
 * anywhere near this soon, but the file itself can be deleted from the project, and a
 * chip whose image no longer loads is worse than no chip — `AttachmentPreview` falls
 * back to the kind plate, and the age limit stops that lingering indefinitely.

 * enough list could fill it and start throwing quota errors on unrelated writes.
