 * ═══ UPLOADING AN ATTACHMENT ════════════════════════════════════════════════
 *
 * Multipart uploads can't go through `api.*` (JSON only), so `vcaasApi.upload` uses raw
 * fetch — the one documented exception.
 *
 * ⚠️ A FAILED UPLOAD MUST BE REPORTED, NOT SWALLOWED. Returning `null` and letting the
 * caller ignore it is how attaching four photos quietly attached one: everything over
 * about 1 MB is refused by a proxy in front of the API, and the user was told nothing at
 * all. Every function here reports which files failed and why, so a surface can say so.
 *
 * ⚠️ AND A REFUSAL IS NOT RETRIED. Retrying a file that is too large just spends three
 * round trips to arrive at the same answer, and delays the message the user needs. Only
 * `retryable` failures (5xx, 429) and outright network errors go round again — the case
 * the retry was added for is a just-created project whose storage is not writable yet.
 */

/**
 * ⭐ THE SAME 8 MB THE API ENFORCES — CHECKED HERE FIRST.
 *
 * The server is still the authority (`MAX_UPLOAD_BYTES` in the API's `vcaas.routes.ts`,
 * with nginx sitting above it at 12 MB so this JSON refusal is the one people see). This
 * copy exists so an oversized file is refused INSTANTLY and locally, instead of being
 * pushed over the wire for several seconds to be rejected at the far end.
 *
 * ⚠️ KEEP IT IN STEP WITH THE API. If they ever disagree, be the SMALLER of the two: a
 * client that lets through what the server refuses just recreates the silent-drop bug.
